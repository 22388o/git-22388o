## I'm currently actively finding a tech internship (remote or in Hanoi), and a mentorship in studying abroad at the USA

## About me
- ***I'm a 17 years old high school student, studying informatics at High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi National University of Education***
- My favourite area is cyber security, especially penetration testing
- My go-to programming language is Python, and my favourite framework is Django. I can also do some C++ (for machine-level related tasks) and Dart (mostly for Flutter)

- **Aiming for :**
  + **OSCP**. Hope I can "Try Harder" and make it the first time.
  + **SAT**. A decent SAT score is required for US universities' admissions.
  + **IELTS**. Aiming at band 7.5.
  
- **Hobbies :**
  + **I'm trying learning Japanese**. Currently aiming at N5, just for fun.
  + **Astronomy and applied physics in general**. I once studied high level physics for specialised physics class in high school, but at the end I chose informatics instead.
  + **Data Science**. Although by far everything I've done is just tutorials and some contests on Kaggle.
  + **Piano**. Mostly play anime songs, thou. Currently trying OldTangPiano's cover of Yoru ni Kakeru.
